Home work 16 -- January-17-2016 explain with examples: 

1) array methods --> forEach, map, reduce, sort, reverse ,... https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array 
forEach --> This method is used to loop over an array. Ex: var x= [1,3,2,5]; x.forEach(function(element){x=x*2;}); //x=[2,6,4,10] 
map --> This method creates a new array with the given function performed on all the elements. Ex: var x = [1,3,4,5];
var y = x.map(function(x){x=x*2;}); // x=[1,3,4,5] y= [2,6,8,10]
reduce -->
sort --> used to sort the elements of an array in an alphabetical order. Ex: ["one","two","three", "1"].sort(); //["1", "one", "three", "two"]

reverse --> used to display the array elements in the reverse order. Ex:["one","two","three", "1"].reverse(); //["1", "three", "two", "one"]

2) what are the different ways to create objects?
three ways to create an object: 
      -->new operator // var dog = new Object();
      -->Object literal: Name-value pairs inside curly braces // var dog ={ name:"snoopy", age:"1", breed:"pug"};
      -->Object constructor: this method can be used to create many objects of same properties. Ex:
      function dog(name, age, breed){
      this.name="snoopy";
      this.age=1;
      this.breed="pug";
      }

3) what are properties in object?
   The values associated to the objects are called properties. In the above example properties of the object 'dog' are name, age and breed.

4) how to retrieve a property value in object?
Syntax to retrieve:   object.propertyName // dog.breed
 					  object.["propertyName"] //dog.["breed"]
 					  object[expression]   // x="breed"; dog[x]

5) how to add a property into object? 
We can simply add a property to an object using assignment operator. Ex: dog.color="white";

6) how to remove a property in object? 
We can remove a property in an object using the keyword 'delete'. Ex: delete dog.breed;

7) how to update a property value in object?
We can update simply by writing the new value. Ex: dog.color = "black";

8) how to check if an property exists with in an object?
We can check that by using 'hasOwnProperty'. Ex: if(dog.hasOwnProperty('age')){console.log("true")}; //true
