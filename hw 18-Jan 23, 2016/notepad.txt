explain by examples

1) What is call, apply and bind in javascript?
call is used to change the values of the keyword 'this'. 
ex: function1.call(name, 'Jhansi', 'Sneha', 'Sandeep');

apply is also used to change the values of the keyword 'this'. But, the values are passed in an array here.
ex: function1.call(name, ['Jhansi', 'Sneha', 'Sandeep']);

bind is used to assign a function with an already existing function if they have the same body.
ex: var sum = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};
var add5 = sum.bind(null, 5);
console.log(add5(10)); // 15

2)what is context in javascript?

3)What is lexical scope?
Lexical scoping: Variables declared outside of a function are global variables and are visible everywhere in a JavaScript program. Variables declared inside a function have function scope and are visible only to code that appears inside that function.
Ex: var scope = 5;
function whatismyscope(){
   var scope = 10;
   function func() {return scope;}
   return func;
}
whatismyscope()(); //10

4) What is for in loop?
For in loop iterates over the properties of an object.
Ex: var obj = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3};
    
	for (var prop in obj) {
	  console.log('obj.' + prop, '=', obj[prop]);
	}

	// Output:
	// "obj.a = 1"
	// "obj.b = 2"
	// "obj.c = 3"
